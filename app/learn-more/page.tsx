            <p>Welcome to Rabble Rabble - a thrilling NFT gambling experience with your friends!

                How does Rabble work?
                Rabble is an engaging and interactive raffle platform where one person creates a lobby to bet their NFTs against their friends.
                
                Ensuring fairness with Chainlink VRF:
                To maintain absolute fairness, we utilize Chainlink VRF for random selection.
                
                Simple participation fee:
                For each participant joining or creating a lobby, there is a nominal $1 charge.
                
                Easy Lobby Creation:
                To begin, the host creates the lobby for the raffle, specifying the number of participants, the NFT collection to be raffled, and the choice between private or public settings.
                
                Share the fun:
                Once the lobby is set up, the host launches lobby links, which can then be shared with friends.
                
                Collection Eligibility:
                To ensure a level playing field, currently, only one collection can participate in a single lobby.
