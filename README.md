## Rabble Rabble README

Rabble Rabble has been designed to offer everyone the chance to engage in gameplay with friends, either as teammates or opponents, involving items of potentially low liquidity or utility. This way, individuals can have an enjoyable experience without significant costs.

The platform is designed for the community to establish open lobbies accommodating 3, 5, 7, or 10 participants. While creating these lobbies, you have the flexibility to set the number of players allowed, the NFT you're willing to stake—this also determines the lobby category—your own rallying cry, and the lobby's name. Once created, you'll receive a shareable QR code and link to distribute among your friends.

Each lobby remains active for a 24-hour span. After this time, the lobby closes, allowing participants to retrieve their NFTs using the initial fee they contributed.

When joining an existing lobby, you can only contribute NFTs from the same collection. Once the lobby reaches its capacity, the games start. Fair randomness in determining winners is ensured through Chainlink VRF.

In the event of a victory or defeat, the page will come alive with confetti. By pressing 'G' or 'F', you can enjoy GIF memes that either celebrate your triumph or pay homage to the NFT that didn't make the cut.

## Main Pages

The platform is organized into three key pages:

1. Lobby Creation -> Choose Lobby Size -> Select NFTs/Collection -> Set Battle Cry & Lobby Name -> Lobby Created.

2. Lobby Page -> Join Raffle -> Choose NFTs -> Joined.

3. Learn More: This section provides a clear overview of the project. In the footer, you'll find a link to the verified contract for utmost transparency.
